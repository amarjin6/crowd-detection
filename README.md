# 🧠**Crowd Detection system**🧧️

## 💡**Our goal**💡 
Analyze live videos throw web-cams about the number of people, located in community centers with the help of neural networks, based on YOLO detection algorithm.

## 🛠**How to Use**🛠
🔴 Clone project to your folder: `git clone https://github.com/amarjin6/crowd-detection.git`

🟡 Run from your IDE or use direct link to our [**SITE**](https://amarjin6.github.io/crowd-detection)

🔵 We're welcome for pull requests and issue updates 📬

🟢 Enjoy!

## 🎆**Our solution**🎆
🎌 **Crowd Detection is a real-time occupancy counting system.** Was created website and server part based on You only look once (YOLO) a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system. Our model has several advantages over classifier-based systems. It looks at the whole image at test time so its predictions are informed by global context in the image. It also makes predictions with a single network evaluation unlike systems like R-CNN which require thousands for a single image. This makes it extremely fast, more than 1000x faster than R-CNN and 100x faster than Fast R-CNN.

## 🔮**Furure goals**🔮
### 🎟️ Coverage of more than 1% of shopping and public centers of the Republic of Belarus for the first year of software implementation
### 🎟️ Building a schedule of attendance of places during the day,      determination of peak hour, generation of reporting documentation
### 🎟️ Ability to add filters to specific items/objects (humans, dogs, men < 18 y.o, women > 18 y.o, working hours)
### 🎟️ Automatic sending and generation of a report for a user-selected period
### 🎟️ • Platform support, ensuring the smooth operation of the system, frequent updates and new features...
